# Interesting coding problems

Most problems were found on Leetcode.

Here I show my solutions for some problems that I found interesting (because they
have an elegant but roundabout solution, tap into interesting concepts, etc). 

There may exist very silimar or completely different solutions elsewhere.
However, here I wanted to explain my own thought process in a way that I could
understand the problem and arrive at the solution.

All code is original and written in C++. The code here is purely for educational
purposes.

## Contents of a solution

Each file contains the source where I found the problem, along with an attempted
explanation (as best as I can do in plaintext without drawing pictures). Then
it will be followed by the actual code used.
