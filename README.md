# Interesting coding problems

Most problems are from Leetcode.

Here I show my own solutions for some problems that I found interesting. You might
find them interesting too! Feel free to leave comments or feedback.

There may exist very silimar or completely different solutions elsewhere. Those 
solutions may be a lot more efficient than my own. Here I just wanted to explain 
my own thought process in a way that I followed to approach the problem and 
arrive at a solution.

All code is original and written in C++20 (primarily because of lambdas and certain
syntax). The code here is purely for educational purposes.

## Contents of a solution

Each file contains the source where I found the problem, along with an attempted
explanation (as best as I can do in plaintext without drawing pictures). Then
it will be followed by the actual code used. This code can be copy-pasted into 
Leetcode if you want to see the runtime.
